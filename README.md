This code will automatically simulate a "j'accepte" press for the WiFi in the PyCon 2015 venue.

Sideload the [APK here](https://github.com/jaxbot/PyconAutoWifi/releases/tag/0.0.1), then you should be good to go. Uninstall after the conference. This just adds a broadcast receiver for whenever the system connects to WiFi to send a few GET/POST requests if the SSID matches "PyCon 2015".

The code is pretty nightmarish. Fixes welcome. Feedback via @jaxbot or jaxbot at gmail.
